## LAB 29.10

To fix initial installation with need to
* remove `moby-containerd` package to avoid conflicts with our own containerd
* remove `--cloud-provider=external` for all components, otherwise kubelet node is going to be marked with `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized` taint as it awaits for second initialization from cloud provider, but we have none. This taint prevent any workloads be scheduled on this node.
